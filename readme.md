# Project Management App
A project for our object oriented programming 2 course made with C# and winforms

## Why we build this App ?
Managing any large or medium scale project can be troublesome specially with large number of members
which task would be assinged to whom, if the task are being completed within time, what is the current

way.

## What we learned
- OOP concepts with C#
- Building a full scale desktop app
- Database handling and CRUD operation

- Working and collaborating with git and github
